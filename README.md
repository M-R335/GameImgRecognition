#Color Image Recognition Script
Introduction
This script is developed for color image recognition, aimed at identifying specified color patterns in real-time. The streamlined approach adopted in this script facilitates color detection with minimal dependencies, making it efficient and easy to deploy.

Dependencies
The script relies on the following Python libraries:

pyautogui: For GUI automation and basic image recognition tasks.
keyboard: For handling keyboard events.
random: For generating random values.
time: For timing control.
File Structure
main.py: Contains the core logic for color image recognition.
test.py: Hosts tests to validate the functionality of the script.
Implementation
The main.py file houses the primary script which utilizes pyautogui for image recognition, while keyboard is employed for event handling. The random and time libraries are used to manage random value generation and script timing respectively, aiding in the smooth operation of the script.

Usage
Ensure the required libraries are installed in your Python environment.
Run main.py to initiate the color image recognition script.
Utilize test.py to validate the scriptâ€™s functionality and performance.
